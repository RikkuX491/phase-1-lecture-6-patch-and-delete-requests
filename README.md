# Phase 1, Lecture 6: PATCH & DELETE Requests

## Lecture Topics

- PATCH requests
- DELETE requests

## Introduction

Today we will continue to build our app for the Flatburger restaurant. We will use fetch() to make a PATCH request to the JSON server (db.json) in response to form submission to update an existing food object in the database. We will also use fetch() to make a DELETE request to the JSON server (db.json) in response to clicking a button to delete an existing food object from the database. We will be using the concepts learned in this lecture to build out this app.

## Setup

- Open the `index.html` file on your browser
- If you are coding along, write your code in the `index.js` file
